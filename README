PaJes - Simple JavaScript Templating Library for generating HTML
================================================================

PaJes is a simple JavaScript templating library for generating well-formed HTML. It can be used to generate innerHTML segments in browser in a safe and clean way without having to resolve to the error prone string concatenation and manual escaping of HTML entities. It can also be used on server side along with server side JavaScript frameworks like node.js as a full blown view templating solution. In fact, PaJes is available as a node.js compatible CommonJS module using file PaJes-CommonJS.js.
